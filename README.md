3. Multi-table joins and aggregations
4. View creation for data abstraction
5. Constraint implementation (CHECK, FOREIGN KEY)

## âœ¨ Key Features
- **Complete Team Management**: Track teams, coaches, and player positions
- **Match Tracking**: Record match dates, participants, and results
- **Advanced Analytics**: Views for coach-specific teams and player position analysis
- **Data Integrity**: Enforced through constraints and relationships
